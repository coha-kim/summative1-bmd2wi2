        <h3>Place in soft, filtered light</h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Auckland’s climate suits Kawakawa well, but for healthy growth, placement is key. Provide it with a spot that gets indirect or dappled sunlight and good airflow. Direct midday sun can stress the plant, so aim for partial shade.<br><br>
        Kawakawa also prefers shelter from strong winds, which can damage its soft leaves. It grows well under the canopy of other plants, along shaded fences, or near covered patios. While Auckland’s rainfall helps keep the soil moist, ensure the area has good drainage. <br><br>
        Kawakawa doesn’t like sitting in waterlogged soil. Indoors, place it near a bright window with filtered light, but keep it away from harsh afternoon sun.
