        <h3>Partial Shade</h3>
        <h3>Filtered sunlgiht</h3>
        <p>Since Auckland summers can get quite sunny, especially in open backyards, itâ€™s best to plant kawakawa in a spot that gets morning light but is protected from the harsh afternoon sun. <br><br>
        Think filtered light, like under a tree or next to a fence that offers partial shade. Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so some shelter helps it thrive. <br><br>
        It grows naturally in the understory of forests. These areas receive filtered sunlight through the canopy of taller trees. The large, heart-shaped leaves can be prone to sunburn and scorching if exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods.
