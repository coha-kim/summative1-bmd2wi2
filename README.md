## Project overview
Akea Haus is an offline retail space focused on creating lasting positive associations with native flora to help reframe conservation by building emotional connections through plant adoptions. 


## What problem does it solve
Akea Haus bridges the gap between awareness and action in conservation by encouraging meaningful connections that lead to genuine care and attention. Adopting native pet plants enables emotional bonds that create positive associations with nature, leading to long-term care and attention. 


## Key features and User flow
1. Registration
Registration is essential in bridging the offline experience to the online experience by scanning the NFC tag that leads them directly to the signup page. Users can either sign in or sign up to link the newly purchased plant to their account. 

2. Personalised care tips 
The category is divided into four crucial aspects of plant care: Light, watering, placement and care. Each category provides quick tips tailored to the user's home location climate with an option to view in-depth information. 

3. Watering tracker
Easily track when the user has watered the plant with a visual tracker.
